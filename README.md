If you click on a map, the app will take you to the individual view of a post where you can see the different points marked and an interactive list where you can navigate to each location to see the information the user has inputed.

Right now, anyone on the site can make a map. Creating the map consists of placing markers down in different places (ideally according to the theme of your map which is described in your Map Title and Description).
